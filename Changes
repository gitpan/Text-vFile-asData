0.03	Thursday 26th May, 2005

	Moved CRLF removing logic down a bit lower into _unwrap_lines.

	Elminate Text::ParseWords by writing our own more C-like version,
	fixes the vCard image segfault issue.


0.02	Wednesday 6th October, 2004

	Moved non-vFile files from examples/ to bin/ as it was mightily
	confusing the round-trip test.

	Added bin/holidays_ical

	Added bin/wgo

	Fixed module name in bin/v2yaml

	Deleted the Encode cargo.  Checking for a BOM on each and
	every line is batshit.

	Added ->preserve_params option to create a new structure which
	preserves the order of the params.


0.01	Thursday 19th February, 2003
