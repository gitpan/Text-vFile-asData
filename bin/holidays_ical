=head1 NAME

holidays_ical - scrape the Holidays wiki page into ics

=head1 DESCRIPTION

So this is why I wanted an iCal generator/parser.

We have an intranet, with a page for who's going to be out of the office
which blech suggested might be good to have available as .ics.

The page is structured roughly like so:

 = 2004

 == February

 * RichardClamp
 ** 1st - 3rd Baying at the moon

This script scrapes that page and makes it available as a vCalendar.
It's called as a cgi so you can subscribe to it with iCal.app and
phpICal.
